# DataKind: Financial Inclusion & Economic Opportunity - Kenya

We carry out Exploratory Data Analysis of the Kenya [2024 FinAccess Household Survey](https://finaccess.knbs.or.ke/reports-and-datasets) for the DataKind event 'Exploring International Economic Opportunity Data and Insights'.

The analysis highlights both strengths (e.g., widespread mobile money usage) and ongoing challenges (e.g., limited access to credit and social protection) in Kenya’s financial inclusion landscape. It suggests that financial inclusion is closely tied to access to mobile technology and broader economic opportunity. To improve financial inclusion, efforts should prioritise expanding access to credit, digital payment systems, and social protection — particularly in areas with high unemployment and informal employment. Given the central role of mobile phones in enabling financial access, expanding digital financial infrastructure in rural and underserved areas could help close remaining gaps and reach more vulnerable populations.
