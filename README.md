# Financial Inclusion & Economic Opportunity - Kenya ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡ª
### *Insights from the 2024 FinAccess Household Survey*

What are the key factors to improving financial inclusion in Kenya?

To find out, I analysed data from 20,871 survey interviews and uncovered the following insights:

* **Financial exclusion remains widespread in Kenya :** Bank account ownership rates vary dramatically â€” from **92.5%** in Nairobi to just **44.1%** in West Pokot.

* **Youth are especially underserved:** only **16.7%** of 15â€“19 year olds have a bank account.

### ðŸ’¡ A pathway to Inclusion ðŸ“±
* Data reveals a strong correlation between mobile phone ownership and access to financial services (e.g., bank accounts, mobile money platforms) In West Pokot, **47.6%** of adults lack a mobile phone. Nationally, **60%** of youths aged 15â€“19 do not own one. <br/> 

* **Expanding mobile phone access** - especially in rural areas and among young people - offers a scalable and high-impact stratgy for advancing financial inclusion.
